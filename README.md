# Curating-data assignment 1
This repository is meant to share the code which was used for the first assignment of the course. Also, the report is included as a pdf file. 

The task was to create a dataset. I decided to choose bottles as objects to collect. I took pictures of them and labeled them accordingly. The possible labels are Kind of bottle(plastic, glass, can), Liquid('Wodka', 'Energy drink', 'Oatmilk', 'Juice', 'Oyster sauce', 'Coke', 'Ingwer shot', 'Oil', 'Water', 'Ketchup', 'Vinegar', 'Wine', 'Fanta', 'Lemonade', 'Beer') and Drinkable(Yes or No). To have an overview I displayed a few here already in the ReadmeFile. You can find the code here in the repository. There is also the whole dataset printed if you execute the code.
